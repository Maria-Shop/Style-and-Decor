            <section class="container-sd">
                <p>Sleep startup Casper has made a splash in the very unsexy mattress industry by selling high-end mattresses without the infamous mattress store markups. And now they’ve zeroed in on a new customer who deserves a good night’s sleep as much
                    as you do: your pup!</p>
                <p>Casper’s latest product is a dog bed that the company claims was brought to market after 460 hours of laboratory testing and 110 prototypes. Casper’s co-founder Neil Parikh told The Verge, "People kept sending us photos of their dogs on
                    their beds, telling us how much their dogs loved their Casper’s. So that kicked us off on a year-long design process to make a better bed for dogs." Your dog can try it out for 100 nights and still return it if they don’t like the
                    way it smells. It’s shaped to make Fido or Fida feel snug as a bug in a rug, by imitating the secure feeling dogs get when they burrow into dirt, or your dirty laundry pile. It’s also designed specifically to withstand any of Fid(o/a)’s
                    playful rages.</p>
                <p>Also, it costs a lot of money. The small bed, for a dog that weighs less than 30 pounds, is $125. The large bed, for dogs up to 90 pounds, is $225.</p>
                <p>Casper’s signature mattress (for humans) has three layers of foam — a bottom layer made of cheap stuff, a middle layer made of "elastic memory foam," and a top layer made of latex foam. That top layer is the fancy stuff — it’s what most
                    mattress stores charge an enormous premium on. Some sleep experts talk about latex foam as if it is the second coming of Christ because it helps keep you cool while you’re asleep. Nothing in this life is worse than night sweating,
                    truly.</p>
                <p>But this dog bed doesn’t come with that special magic foam. It only has the cheap-o bottom foam layer, and a slightly ritzier memory foam top layer. According to Parikh, dogs don’t need the latex layer because they’re much better than
                    people at regulating their body temperature.</p>
                <p>I asked Parikh whether he thinks people will actually spring for a $225 dog bed and he told me "It’s definitely a lot cheaper than what you would pay if you were getting a high-end dog bed from a pet store. It’s probably more expensive
                    than if you went to a Costco or a Petco, but just like how you spend a third of your life sleeping, your dog probably spends even a little more, so it’s something that’s important to invest in and it will last a long time."I feel sort
                    of obligated to doubt how much dogs care about mattress design, considering these are animals that will eat until they throw up. But I won’t tell you what to do with your money!</p>
                <p>Orders for the Casper Dog Mattress are open now, and will ship by September 6th.</p>
